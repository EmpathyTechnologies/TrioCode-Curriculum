# Git

Git is used for managing source code and version control in software projects.

Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

Version control keeps track of all changes made to files over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed

Key Terms:

Repository: A repository is a collection of files, along with their complete history and metadata.

Commit: A commit represents a snapshot of the project at a particular point in time.

# Command-Line Interace (CLI)

The Terminal (for macOS users) and Git Bash (for Windows users) are command-line interfaces to execute commands, such as git commands that manage your software project source code repositories.
